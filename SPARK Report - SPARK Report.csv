suite of remote-sensing-based snow products into the NWM. The foundation of our methodology
is a post-processing algorithm developed by the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) at
the University of Colorado to create daily, spatially and temporally consistent estimates of
fractional snow-covered area, clean snow albedo, and dust radiative forcing, products which
perform better than traditional MODIS snow products. University of California at Santa Barbara
(UCSB) will expand this product suite in high-priority target regions with near-real-time snow
water equivalent (SWE) estimates derived by an efficient machine-learning algorithm trained on
the NSIDC remote-sensing suite and a historical SWE reconstruction model. To bring this rich
data suite into the NWM, the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) has devised an
ensemble particle-filter assimilation method to winnow the long-range forecast ensemble set to
""optimal"" combinations of model parameters and forecasts that best replicate the snow
observations, inserting uncertainty consistent with the observations back into the long-range
analysis. To test the new framework, the team will conduct a system-level demonstration of the
NWM long-range forecast configuration for the 2018-2019 period with weekly regional snow
state and parameter updates, including full computational benchmarking and feasibility
assessment for U.S.-wide implementation.","The long-range configuration is ideally suited for our data-model fusion approach. Its simpler
process representation and faster computational speeds allow parameter and forcing ensembles to
become computationally tractable, permitting seamless assimilation of high-quality, high-impact
observations like the NSIDC snow suite. With modest effort, we believe this expanded system
will make substantial improvements in the accuracy and relevance of the NWM seasonal
forecasts to water resource managers.","NWC","Israel Jirak","University of Colorado

Many critical decisions are made in local jurisdictions in advance of severe weather. These decisions are generally considered as being made ""by emergency managers,"" but that is an oversimplification of the complexity of decisions and actions taking
place. For example, schools, fire, and public works departments all make high-impact, costly decisions on whether to prepare for a forecasted event. Schools decide whether to delay start, end the school day early, or cancel after-school activities to keep students safe. These decisions impact the parents of young
children who must arrange for childcare. Fire and public works departments' decisions may mean that extra staff is required to retrieve and prepare equipment. Any preparation decision has a financial cost and some of these are borne widely throughout a community (e.g., school closures). These decisions are best
made 4-6 hours in advance - if not the day or night before - to allow for adequate preparation, but that is a time when forecast uncertainty is generally still quite high, particularly in terms of which specific cities or counties will be affected. Many of these decisions, whether made with forecast information from public or private sources, are anchored in the Storm Prediction Center's (SPC) Day 1 Outlook and
Mesoscale Convective Discussion products. The SPC is currently testing enhanced tools (SPC temporal guidance) that may assist both local forecasters and schools, fire, and public works in local decision-making.

dynamical and statistical tools, such as week 3-4 forecasts from operational models including the
Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2), European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
Forecasts (ECMWF), and NOAA Global Ensemble Forecast System version 12 (GEFSv12).
However, while helpful for informing outlooks, dynamical climate models can be systematically
biased and lack reliability of probabilities in temperature and precipitation forecasts. Statistical
calibration of models can improve bias and reliability beyond the potential gains of advances in
dynamical models, and without the need to make changes to the base model code, necessitating
an updated model release. Currently, CFSv2, ECMWF, and the Japan Meteorological Agency
(JMA) models are calibrated for week 3-4 using ensemble regression. However, a novel
calibration method based on Bayesian statistics for the week 3-4 and seasonal timescales -
Bayesian Joint Probability (BJP) calibration - has shown to improve skill and reliability of
2-meter temperature over raw dynamical models in a test environment using three Subseasonal
Prediction Experiment (SubX) models; CFSv2, GEFSv12, and the NOAA Earth System
Research Laboratories (ESRL-FIMv2) model; and to improve the skill and reliability of seasonal
precipitation predictions when applied to the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME).
Given the success of BJP calibration for week 3-4 2-meter temperature, and seasonal 2-meter
temperature and precipitation, we propose to (1) apply the BJP calibration methodology to the
operational models that support week 3-4 forecasts at CPC including CFSv2, ECMWF,

(ARL), is one of the mostly widely used models for atmospheric trajectory and dispersion
calculations in the world (Stein and Draxler et. al 2015). It is NOAA's operational model for
emergency response applications including the simulation of atmospheric plumes from
radionuclide emissions, chemical releases, smoke originating from wildfires or prescribed burns,
volcanic eruptions, and wind-blown dust. Several HYSPLIT applications are close to
transitioning to operations including probabilistic products and the Transfer Coefficient Matrix,
TCM, approach for nuclear release applications. Probabilistic products for volcanic ash
developed under the JTTI FY18 project will help fulfill new requirements expected from the
International Civil Aviation Organization, ICAO, for volcanic ash advisories issued by NOAA's
two Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers. The TCM approach for nuclear release applications will
fulfill requests by the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, and the World Meteorological
Organization, WMO. In future projects, the TCM approach can be further expanded to support
top-down estimation of wildfire smoke emissions as well as volcanic ash emissions and utilize
ensemble output.","In emergency response situations, uncertainty in the magnitudes of modeled concentrations may be up to a few orders of magnitude due to uncertainty in the source term. However, this uncertainty often decreases as better emissions estimates become available. During an emergency, estimates of emissions are often updated frequently as new measurements and information becomes available. With a Transfer COefficient Matrix (TCM) approach, model forecasts do not have to be re-run every time new emissions estimates are available. Simulations may even be completed before any emissions estimates are available, e.g. in the case of an ongoing event in which future emissions are expected but unknown. It also allows for efficient implementation of source term ensembles. When emissions are uncertain, an ensemble of possible emissions may be utilized to produce probabilistic output. The TCM approach allows the same set of model runs to be used for different emissions estimates. The TCM is also utilized in an inversion algorithm along with observations to produce estimates of emissions. This approach is effective for estimating emissions from volcanoes, wildfires, and radiological releases (Chai et. al 2015, Chai et. al 2017, Cheol et. al. 2020). Such emissions estimates can then be fed back into the Unified Forecast System (UFS) system.","EMC","Jeff McQueen (EMC)","OAR/ARL/NCEP","WPO22-JTTI-I-10","Relevant to All Hazards","Maryland","Crawford","Joint Technology Transfer Initiative (JTTI)","2022","May 2022 - April 2025","<span class=""material-symbols-outlined status-icon active"" title=""Active"">search_activity</span>","Atmospheric Composition and Chemistry, Aviation, Data Assimilation and Ensembles, Probabilistic Weather Forecasting","transitioning hysplit to operations, this proposal advances two capabilities the use of noaa's ensemble forecasting systems to produce probabilistic forecasts and the implementation of a transfer coefficient matrix tcm approach for hysplit, the hysplit model developed and maintained at noaa air resources laboratory arl is one of the mostly widely used models for atmospheric trajectory and dispersion calculations in the world stein and draxler et al 2015 it is noaa's operational model for emergency response applications including the simulation of atmospheric plumes from radionuclide emissions chemical releases smoke originating from wildfires or prescribed burns volcanic eruptions and wind blown dust several hysplit applications are close to transitioning to operations including probabilistic products and the transfer coefficient matrix tcm approach for nuclear release applications probabilistic products for volcanic ash developed under the jtti fy18 project will help fulfill new requirements expected from the international civil aviation organization icao for volcanic ash advisories issued by noaa's two volcanic ash advisory centers the tcm approach for nuclear release applications will fulfill requests by the international atomic energy agency iaea and the world meteorological organization wmo in future projects the tcm approach can be further expanded to support top down estimation of wildfire smoke emissions as well as volcanic ash emissions and utilize ensemble output","Environmental Modeling Center (EMC)","OAR/ARL/NCEP","<img src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PART-WPO/SPARK/refs/heads/main/icons/all-tp.PNG"" alt=""All Hazards"" />","https://part-wpo.github.io/reach-dashboard/?award=WPO22-JTTI-I-10","This proposal advances two capabilities: the use of NOAA's ensemble forecasting systems to produce probabilistic forecasts and the implementation of a Transfer Coefficient Matrix, TCM, approach for HYSPLIT."

Forecasters working under strict time constraints often do not have time to thoroughly interrogate and investigate the wealth of information contained in an ensemble forecast. To address this, Stony Brook University (SBU) in collaboration with Weather Prediction Center (WPC) has a current JTTI project to implement a real-time ensemble clustering tool using a 100-member ensemble from the GEFS, CMC, and EC ensembles for days 3-7 and 8-10. The generation of cluster scenarios are enhancing forecaster understanding of the ensemble solutions and are in increasingly heavy use throughout the NWS. However, users have requested more information and tools to understand how the atmosphere needs to evolve in the proceeding days for a particular cluster scenario to come to fruition. In a recent CSTAR project, Stony Brook University (SBU) developed an Ensemble Sensitivity Analysis (ESA) tool that has been running operationally at EMC using either GEFS, GEFS+CMC, or EC ensembles. This tool uses the patterns in the ensemble spread of SLP to calculate upstream sensitive regions for high impact weather, which can help forecasters better understand the origin of the ensemble uncertainty. This will help with forecaster situational awareness and Impact-based Decision Support, as well as potentially help with NOAA reconnaissance targeting efforts during the winter. The overarching goal of this proposed project is to make the current SBU ESA tool operational while testing and including additional mid-latitude hazards, such as heavy precipitation, strong winds, extreme cold, heat, and wind. We will focus on the days 3-7 and 8-10 given the interest in extremes in the medium and long-range forecasts using the same set of ensembles as the clustering (GEFS, CMC, and EC). We will develop an interactive way for forecasters to choose a variable and region of interest. This expanded ESA tool will be validated objectively to determine if it is targeting the correct upstream areas, and it will also be evaluated within the Hydrometeorological Testbed, in particular the Winter Weather Experiment and Extended Forecast Experiments. Forecasters will learn how to utilize this tool in concert with our recently developed clustering tool as well as other ensemble tools. There will also be forecaster training to learn how to use the ensemble sensitivity tools in operations using online resources, modules, testbed discussions, and outreach during NWS operational workshops.","As with the ensemble clustering tool, the beneficiaries of the ESA tool will be WPC and NWS WFOs. THe ESA website and training materials will also be publicly available so the public and private organization may also access the data and directly reap its benefits. Overall, this project will have large societal benefits, since forecasters will have more situational awareness about the ensemble solutions and model trends, which will in turn likely help with the forecasts and communication of the scenarios to stakeholders. Similar to the tropical storm reconnaissance, there is interest in using an ESA tool for winter storm reconnaissance flights over Gulf of Mexico, eastern Pacific, or western Atlantic (Dr. Peter Black, personal communication 2021), and these targeted observations may help improve the model forecast guidance for major storm events.","WPC","Jim Nelson (WPC)","Stony Brook University

wave, and surface ocean current in the 3-Dimensional Real Time Mesoscale Analysis (3D-
RTMA). Analysis of marine variables requires an effective exploitation of observational
information and the integration of models that capture key processes and air-sea interactions
occurring over a wide range of spatial and time scales. The proposed system aims to improve the
blending of global and local-scale weather and oceanographic variability in the RTMA by
expanding the JEDI protocols to include marine observations, use advanced data assimilation
schemes, and by using sound scientific principles of mesoscale modeling. The products of the
operational (2D) RTMA are used for guidance, monitoring, and forecast verification in NWS
forecast offices. This project will extend this capability to support offices in charge of providing
marine and ocean analysis products and information by establishing skillful estimates of the state
of waters at the margins of the continental U.S. Its outcomes will facilitate mesoscale data to a
community of practice for observing data impact, data integration, and coastal model evaluation.
This project pursues four key analysis enhancements: physical consistency in the three-way
interaction wind-waves-currents, reduced bias of the background fields, higher fidelity of fields,
and improved analysis uncertainty. To achieve the proposed enhancements the following
objectives are pursued: (1) increase the robustness of the data quality control system for marine
and ocean variables-especially the High-Frequency radar and satellite altimetry data, (2)
implement the IODA libraries for preparation of forward operators for each of the new
observations to be included, (3) implement an appropriate configuration of the regional MOM6
ocean model to provide surface current's first guess fields, (4) implement a field-alignment
processing scheme for positional and amplitude error reduction in the background fields, (5)
develop and evaluate configurations of the background error covariance across the three fields,
and (6) design, develop, and test a hybrid data assimilation scheme of wind-wave assimilation
constrained to current conditions. The proposed advancements of the data assimilation scheme will
leverage on the ongoing NOAA developments of the 3D-RTMA, the UFS, and the JEDI project.
In turn, this project will lead developments towards future coupled wind-wave-current data
assimilation schemes.","The final product of this proposal is a data assimilation scheme for the marine component of the
3D-RTMA with the following enhancements: (1) increased robustness of the data quality control

The goal of HAFS is to provide forecast guidance for wind, storm surge, rainfall, and other weather hazards associated with landfalling hurricanes. This project will be a coordinated effort directed by the lead-PI, Aksoy (University of Miami, UM), and institutional PI's Wang (Oklahoma University, OU), and Poterjoy (University of Maryland, UMD).                                                                                                                                     Our project will coordinate with NOAA's Environmental Modeling Center (EMC) to directly address the JTTI-1 goal to ""further develop, test and enhance data assimilation (DA) techniques"" for HAFS. The PIs are already collaborating in a joint project in response to the NOAA RFA ""FY19 Disaster Supplement'' through June 2022 to develop various components of the atmospheric HAFS-DA system. This work has yielded a self-cycled, dual-resolution-capable, hybrid DA system and has been tested on a relatively small number of cases. Results so far indicate that further optimization is needed to improve the performance of this system, which is one of the main goals of our proposed work. New developments, as jointly agreed upon with the EMC, are also proposed. These developments include added capability to assimilate GOES-R Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) all-sky radiance observations and improve the HAFS ensemble to obtain suitable ocean-aware background error covariances for atmospheric data assimilation. Finally, all developments will be integrated to the framework of the Joint Effort for Data assimilation Integration (JEDI).
A further goal of this proposal is to address the goals JTTI-1(a) to ""develop, test and enhance coupled data assimilation techniques"" and JTTI-1(c) to ""develop and refine ensemble framework for the coupled UFS prototypes."" Although our main goal in the first two years of the project is to focus on providing a fully functional atmospheric hybrid DA system to the EMC, in the third year we will focus on re-optimizing atmospheric DA in the context of a coupled atmosphere-ocean system that is expected to be available at that time. This will yield a fully optimized, ocean-aware atmospheric DA capability that will be the natural stepping stone toward NOAA's ultimate goal of a fully integrated atmosphere-ocean modeling and DA system for HAFS.","Integrated outcomes and qualitative assessment: In addition to the individual developments by the three groups that will become operational, a revisit of all atmospheric DA parameters for a coupled atmosphere-ocean DA system will allow a re-tuned and optimized atmospheric DA capability to emerge within the JEDI system ready for operational application by the end of the project period. This activity will naturally require the availability of a functional coupled atmosphere-ocean DA system that is expected to be developed independently from the proposed work here. However, the lead PI Aksoy (UM) is directly involved in a separate proposal being submitted to the same opportunity by UM that is titled ""Advancing UFS-HAFS toward the Next-Generation Modeling System with Coupled Data Assimilation Using JEDI,"" which focuses on advancing the ocean data assimilation for HAFS through further developing the Marine JEDI for regional hurricane application. Meanwhile, Co-PI (Wang) also leads a third proposal focusing on
developing the coupled ocean - atmosphere background ensemble covariances for both weakly and strongly coupled DA for hurricane prediction. The three proposals are complementary to each other and naturally synergistic.","EMC","May need new POC

prototype intensity forecast products that include a measure of uncertainty. The PIs are currently
collaborating with NHC via the UCAR/COMET NWS Partners program to assess the public's
understanding of these prototype forecast products. The goals of the proposed project are:
1. to develop modified, experimental formats (i.e., message conditions) of NHC's prototype
intensity forecast products based on the results and recommendations of the ongoing
UCAR/COMET project and stakeholder input (e.g., NHC and NWS forecasters,
emergency managers, broadcast meteorologists);
2. to evaluate each message condition using the Internalization, Distribution, Explanation,
Action (IDEA) model framework (e.g., Sellnow et al., 2017; Sellnow & Sellnow, 2019) to
determine the forecast product format and messaging channel (e.g., static image, television
broadcast) that exhibits the greatest message clarity regarding the risk of wind impacts
from TCs and exhibits the greatest message effectiveness based on the public's perceived
risks of wind impacts from TCs to their life and property.","The primary outcome of this project will be the improved communication of TC intensity forecast
uncertainty to general publics via a new TC intensity forecast product. Prototype products have
been developed at NHC. The PIs, in collaboration with NOAA stakeholders and partners, will
create multiple redesigns of the prototype products and test their clarity and effectiveness among
general publics. The experimental forecast products will be considered successful if survey results from public end-users indicate that the experimental forecast products receive statistically

interactions. In addition, the enhanced lake-wave coupling capabilities will build the basis for
improved coastal applications in the Great Lakes domain and will make the coastal applications
UFS-compliant. This accomplishes the mission of the NWS to protect life and property, and to
enhance the national economy. In particular, improved forecasts of LES will protect the safety of
the citizens in the Great Lakes region and enable NOAA to achieve the overarching goals of a

precipitation. In the U.S., particularly over coastal regions along the West Coast, Alaska, and
Hawaii, a significant fraction of precipitation results from warm rain, which is formed by the
collision and coalescence of liquid water droplets. Despite its importance, warm rain is often
poorly represented by modern numerical weather prediction models. Specifically, warm rain is
characterized by large numbers of small raindrops; in contrast, virtually all current microphysical
parameterizations incorrectly model such situations as more like cold rain, with greater numbers
of large drops. Results of model evaluations undertaken by the PI and his research group have
shown that the Thompson-Eidhammer microphysical parameterization scheme, which is the
parameterization that will be used by the UFS, suffers from these warm rain deficiencies.
To address these biases, we have modified the Thomson-Eidhammer parameterization to
simulate warm rain more accurately. The parameterization modifications, called RCON, have been
extensively tested over coastal Washington State and show significant promise toward improving
precipitation forecasts over Alaska and Hawaii. RCON produces broader cloud droplet size
distributions during warm rain environments, resulting in greater production of warm rain.
During the proposed project, we will work with scientists and collaborators at
NOAA/EMC, as well as scientists/forecasters in Washington State, Alaska, and Hawaii to
implement and evaluate the RCON parameterization in the UFS model. The evaluation will
include a global evaluation using the GFS and regional evaluations using the HRRR/RRFS
modeling systems. The proposed project promises more accurate precipitation forecasts for a
variety of environmental conditions. By adopting the RCON changes into the UFS model, we also
expect other benefits, including better forecasting of wet and icy surface conditions, as well as
better forecasts of solar radiation and convection.","The primary impacts and benefits of the proposed project are more accurate UFS

We recently demonstrated a Bayesian statistical method for post-processing seasonal forecasts of mean temperature and precipitation from the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME). We now seek to test the utility of an updated hybrid statistical-dynamical prediction system that facilitates seamless subseasonal and seasonal forecasting. Specific updates we intend to implement for the forecast system include: 1) Aggregation of post-processed daily forecasts to enhance the skill of subseasonal forecasts on weekly and biweekly timescales; and 2) Disaggrega- tion of seasonal forecasts to determine the probability of daily extremes. We propose to apply the method developed by the co-PIs of this proposal (Schepen et al., 2017b) to first calibrate climate model daily forecasts through Bayesian joint probability modeling and then relate these calibrated daily forecasts made at different leads through application of the Schaake Shuffle approach (Clark et al., 2004). The calibrated and shuffled daily forecasts will then be aggregated for subseasonal and seasonal prediction. Through this approach, forecast skill that exists at shorter subseasonal leads (e.g., weeks 1-2) will be used to improve forecast skill at longer leads (e.g., weeks 3-4). Furthermore, using the methodology developed by the co-PIs (Schepen et al., 2017a), we propose to disaggregate seasonal forecasts from the NMME into distributions of daily values. We will first develop hybrid statistical-dynamical models that use skillful NMME forecasts of large scale climate patterns (e.g., ENSO) in statistical models that relate these remote climate patterns to North American temperature and precipitation variability. Forecasts from these hybrid models first will be used to predict seasonal temperature and precipitation, and then will be statistically disaggregated to generate consistent, seamless forecasts of the distribution of daily temperatures or precipitation amounts. The probability of daily extremes of tem- perature or precipitation during a seasonal forecast period will be produced, taking full advantage of the enhanced predictability offered by interannual models of variability, such as ENSO, the Arctic Oscillation, or climate change. Importantly, this method allows for the representation of daily extremes consistent with climate conditions. This project explores the use of machine learning.","Reliable probabilistic forecasts of the occurrence of daily extremes associated with subseasonal and seasonal variability from calibrated dynamical models will increase the public awareness of the link between climate events and daily extremes, potentially reduce the cost of such events economically, and reduce risk to the health and safety of the population.","CPC","Dan Collins","NOAA/NWS/CPC","OWAQ18-CTB-I-1","Extreme Temperatures, Water Extremes","Maryland","Collins","Testbeds","2018","August 2018 - September 2021","<span class=""material-icons status-icon complete"" title=""Complete"">check_circle</span>","Artificial Intelligence (AI) / Machine Learning (ML), Data Assimilation and Ensembles, Dynamics and Nesting, Forecast Skill Metrics, Post-processing, Probabilistic Weather Forecasting, Teleconnections","a hybrid statistical dynamical system for the seamless prediction of daily extremes and subseasonal to seasonal climate variability, to demonstrate the skill and suitability for operations of a statistical dynamical prediction system that yields seamless probabilistic forecasts of daily extremes and sub seasonal to seasonal temperature and precipitation, we propose to demonstrate the skill and suitability for operations of a statistical dynamical prediction system that yields seamless probabilistic forecasts of daily extremes and subseasonal to seasonal temperature and precipitation we recently demonstrated a bayesian statistical method for post processing seasonal forecasts of mean temperature and precipitation from the north american multi model ensemble nmme we now seek to test the utility of an updated hybrid statistical dynamical prediction system that facilitates seamless subseasonal and seasonal forecasting specific updates we intend to implement for the forecast system include 1 aggregation of post processed daily forecasts to enhance the skill of subseasonal forecasts on weekly and biweekly timescales and 2 disaggrega tion of seasonal forecasts to determine the probability of daily extremes we propose to apply the method developed by the co pis of this proposal schepen et al 2017b to first calibrate climate model daily forecasts through bayesian joint probability modeling and then relate these calibrated daily forecasts made at different leads through application of the schaake shuffle approach clark et al 2004 the calibrated and shuffled daily forecasts will then be aggregated for subseasonal and seasonal prediction through this approach forecast skill that exists at shorter subseasonal leads e g weeks 1 2 will be used to improve forecast skill at longer leads e g weeks 3 4 furthermore using the methodology developed by the co pis schepen et al 2017a we propose to disaggregate seasonal forecasts from the nmme into distributions of daily values we will first develop hybrid statistical dynamical models that use skillful nmme forecasts of large scale climate patterns e g enso in statistical models that relate these remote climate patterns to north american temperature and precipitation variability forecasts from these hybrid models first will be used to predict seasonal temperature and precipitation and then will be statistically disaggregated to generate consistent seamless forecasts of the distribution of daily temperatures or precipitation amounts the probability of daily extremes of tem perature or precipitation during a seasonal forecast period will be produced taking full advantage of the enhanced predictability offered by interannual models of variability such as enso the arctic oscillation or climate change importantly this method allows for the representation of daily extremes consistent with climate conditions this project explores the use of machine learning","Climate Prediction Center (CPC)","NOAA/NWS/CPC","","https://part-wpo.github.io/reach-dashboard/?award=OWAQ18-CTB-I-1","To demonstrate the skill and suitability for operations of a statistical-dynamical prediction system that yields seamless probabilistic forecasts of daily extremes and sub seasonal-to-seasonal temperature and precipitation."

The Real-time Multivariate MJO (RMM) index is commonly used to measure MJO prediction skill and used as a predictor for predictions of other parameters over the globe. This index has proven to be very useful in providing information of the planetary-scale circulation pattern associated with the MJO and eastward propagation of the MJO in a statistical sense. But it is known to be ineffective in accurately identifying longitudinal locations of convection centers for individual MJO events. This shortcoming of the RMM index has hindered its applications in predicting remote influences of the MJO, which sensitively depend on longitudinal locations of MJO convection centers. Recently, we have developed a new method that identifies individual MJO events by tracking eastward motion of large-scale precipitation anomalies along the equator. This method allows several key parameters to be quantitatively and accurately defined for individual MJO events. The parameters include the longitude and time of MJO initiation and termination, speed and range of MJO propagation, life span and mean strength of the MJO, and intervals of neighboring MJO events. Prediction of these parameters is important in capturing the tropical forcing of subtropical and extratropical circulations at intraseasonal timescales, but is difficult to derive from the RMM index. The new MJO tracking method has been used successfully in quantifying the barrier effect on MJO propagation by the Indo-Pacific Maritime Continent and interpreting the issue of MJO simulations by global models. With suitable minor adjustment, this method can be applied to real-time MJO forecast and provide an alternative technique for monitoring MJO events and measuring their prediction skill. The objective of this proposed project is to revise and test the new method of MJO tracking for real-time application in enhancing our ability to predict the MJO and its related extremes. We plan to take the existing MJO tracking method and develop it into one that can be used in real- time forecast. The proposed work includes: (1) Adjust the existing MJO tracking method to make it applicable to real-time forecast. (2) Apply the real-time tracking method to CFSv2 historical reforecast to develop a statistical base of MJO forecast skill as a function of the season and the MJO (initiation location, etc.). (3) Compare MJO prediction measurement based on this new tracking method and other EOF- based methods (RMM index, OLR index) and seek possible ways to complement each other. (4) Test the new MJO tracking method or tracking-EOF hybrid method in real-time environment. These steps will be applied to CFSv2 forecast only. If successful, we plan to expand this work to S2S Prediction products or NMME in a follow-up project.","Accurate identification of individual MJO events, especially longitudinal locations of their convection, is critical to assess their global impacts and its predictability. The proposed work aims at applying a new MJO tracking method for improvement of the real-time MJO monitoring and prediction. Such an effort will enhance our understanding of the MJO relationship to the weather and climate in the subtropics and extratropics and the MJO predictability, and is beneficial to the scientific community in general. Improved MJO monitoring and prediction will benefit the general public by providing more reliable climate assessment and prediction.","CPC","Wanqiu Wang","NOAA/OAR/PMEL","OWAQ18-CTB-I-2","Relevant to All Hazards","Washington","Zhang","Testbeds","2018","August 2018 - January 2022","<span class=""material-icons status-icon complete"" title=""Complete"">check_circle</span>","Forecast Skill Metrics, Teleconnections","a new technique for improved mjo prediction, to revise and test the new method of mjo tracking for real time application in enhancing our ability to predict the mjo and its related extremes, predicting the madden julian oscillation mjo is key to global prediction on subseasonal to seasonal s2s timescales the real time multivariate mjo rmm index is commonly used to measure mjo prediction skill and used as a predictor for predictions of other parameters over the globe this index has proven to be very useful in providing information of the planetary scale circulation pattern associated with the mjo and eastward propagation of the mjo in a statistical sense but it is known to be ineffective in accurately identifying longitudinal locations of convection centers for individual mjo events this shortcoming of the rmm index has hindered its applications in predicting remote influences of the mjo which sensitively depend on longitudinal locations of mjo convection centers recently we have developed a new method that identifies individual mjo events by tracking eastward motion of large scale precipitation anomalies along the equator this method allows several key parameters to be quantitatively and accurately defined for individual mjo events the parameters include the longitude and time of mjo initiation and termination speed and range of mjo propagation life span and mean strength of the mjo and intervals of neighboring mjo events prediction of these parameters is important in capturing the tropical forcing of subtropical and extratropical circulations at intraseasonal timescales but is difficult to derive from the rmm index the new mjo tracking method has been used successfully in quantifying the barrier effect on mjo propagation by the indo pacific maritime continent and interpreting the issue of mjo simulations by global models with suitable minor adjustment this method can be applied to real time mjo forecast and provide an alternative technique for monitoring mjo events and measuring their prediction skill the objective of this proposed project is to revise and test the new method of mjo tracking for real time application in enhancing our ability to predict the mjo and its related extremes we plan to take the existing mjo tracking method and develop it into one that can be used in real time forecast the proposed work includes 1 adjust the existing mjo tracking method to make it applicable to real time forecast 2 apply the real time tracking method to cfsv2 historical reforecast to develop a statistical base of mjo forecast skill as a function of the season and the mjo initiation location etc 3 compare mjo prediction measurement based on this new tracking method and other eof based methods rmm index olr index and seek possible ways to complement each other 4 test the new mjo tracking method or tracking eof hybrid method in real time environment these steps will be applied to cfsv2 forecast only if successful we plan to expand this work to s2s prediction products or nmme in a follow up project","Climate Prediction Center (CPC)","NOAA/OAR/PMEL","<img src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PART-WPO/SPARK/refs/heads/main/icons/all-tp.PNG"" alt=""All Hazards"" />","https://part-wpo.github.io/reach-dashboard/?award=OWAQ18-CTB-I-2","To revise and test the new method of MJO tracking for real-time application in enhancing our ability to predict the MJO and its related extremes."

These time scales of weeks-to-months are at the heart of the mission for NOAA's Climate Prediction Center (CPC), which has been particularly focused on expanding and improving their 3-4-week forecasts. Dynamical S2S models have improved significantly over recent years, but they have yet to fully tap the potential predictability of coherent tropical modes like the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). A unique approach to this problem has been implemented on NCICS.org/mjo. This website takes recent observations and appends them with 45-day forecasts from the Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2). The combined data are then Fourier filtered in space and time for some of the dominant modes of S2S variability in the tropics: the MJO, convectively coupled equatorial waves, and low-frequency variability like the El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). This filtering highlights the most predictable aspects of the S2S system. The website includes numerous maps, Hovmllers, and indices for identifying and predicting these modes. It has been updating daily since 2011 with several upgrades and iterations over the years. These diagnostics have become routine inputs for CPC's Global Tropical Hazards (GTH) outlook. NCICS.org/mjo has reached a level a maturity (Readiness Level 7) where it is a prime candidate to be transitioned fully into operations at CPC. This proposal outlines that transition. It also includes some modest development work that will use proven methods to further tailor these diagnostics to CPC's goals. Once these processes have been transferred to CPC, future work could easily expand them to other models that CPC is already ingesting. The proposed project is directly to the MAPP/NOAA Climate Test Bed competition because it takes a demonstrated research product and transitions it into operations at NOAA's CPC. In particular, the proposal leverages a newly proved methodology to improve key forecast products like the Weeks 3-4 outlooks. Transitioning this product to operations will help NOAA fulfill its long-term climate goals by expanding CPC's capabilities for monitoring and prediction using existing models and observations. These diagnostics are already used by a number of public, private, academic, and international users to provide them the climate intelligence they need for resilience against climate variability.","NCICS.org/mjo currently provides tropical diagnostics to hundreds of users every month (Fig. 11).

As a major contribution to regional air pollution, they affect public health and the economy. Accurate monitoring of global aerosols thus has significant societal and environmental benefits. To improve global aerosol representation, an ensemble-based global aerosol data assimilation (DA) system has been developed at NOA by ""optimally"" combining information from aerosol observations and model outputs.                                                                                                             Due to large aerosol model uncertainty and limited temporal and/or spatial coverage of aerosol observations, continuous global aerosol reanalysis produced through DA plays an essential role in understanding aerosol characteristics and its impact on weather, climate, and air quality. Here, we propose to produce a five-year global aerosol reanalysis for t2018-2022 as an extension of our currently funded project of ""Joint NOAA-NASA Development of a Data Assimilation System for Aerosol Reanalysis and Forecasting"" (NA18OAR4310281), 2018-2021). Specifically, the global aerosol reanalysis datasets will be produced by (a) using the NOA United Forecast System (UFS)-Aerosols coupled with NASA's second-generation Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) parameterization that includes nitrate aerosols, (b) leveraging three-dimensional ensemble-variational (3DEnVar) application with the local ensemble transform Kalman filter (LETKF) for ensemble update in the Joint Efforts for Data Assimilation (JEDI) for aerosol assimilation, (c) assimilating aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals at 550 nm derived from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instruments onboard NOAA's satellites, and (d) verifying against independent ground- and satellite-based aerosol observations and aerosol reanalysis following NCEP/EMC's metrics.","The main goal of this project is to produce a long-term global aerosol reanalysis product at NOAA in support of climate monitoring and prediction. As a result, this project will help fill NOAA's gap in aerosol reanalysis compared to other research and operational centers (e.g., NASA, ECMWF, and JMA). On the other hand, the development and evaluation of multiple aerosol reanalysis products offer an opportunity to better investigate uncertainties associated with aerosol processes, measurements, and modeling. This will help enhance understanding of aerosol characteristics, aerosol modeling, and its impact on weather, climate, and air quality. This will further benefit weather, climate and air pollution prediction. IN addition, this project contributes to NOAA's NGGPS effort towards developing a unified Earth modeling system by advancing the aerosol component to keep up with other components. Specifically, S. Frolov from NOAA/OAR/PSL and S. Penny from CU/CIRES are leading a UFS R2O project that is aiming to produce a 30 year reanalysis of the coupled atmosphere, ocean, ice, and land reanalysis in FY23-24. This coupled reanalysis will be used to calibrate and test GEFS and SFS forecasting systems. Future versions of this reanalysis product will need to incorporate the aerosol assimilation. Therefore, this project will develop the necessary technology and the observational datasets that will enable inclusion of the aerosols into the future versions of the fully coupled UFS reanalysis. Finally, science and techniques resulting from this project will further contribute to aerosol-related development and applications in JEDI at JCSDA, validation of VIIRS AOD retrieval products (e.g. VIIRS AOD retrieval bias and error) at NOAA/NESDIS, and evaluation and enhancement of UFS-Aerosols at NCEP/EMC and NOAA/OAR/GSL.","EMC","Cory Martin (EMC)","CIRES/University of Colorado","NA22OAR4590219","Relevant to All Hazards","Colorado","Huang","Testbeds","2022","August 2022 - July 2026","<span class=""material-symbols-outlined status-icon active"" title=""Active"">search_activity</span>","Atmospheric Composition and Chemistry, Coupled Models & Techniques, Data Assimilation and Ensembles, Reanalysis & Reforecasting, Parameterization, Satellite & Remote Sensing Technologies","development of a global aerosol reanalysis at noaa in support of climate monitoring and prediction, to produce a long term global aerosol reanalysis product at noaa in support of climate monitoring and prediction, atmospheric aerosols become increasingly important in weather and climate systems due to their impact on solar radiation and clouds as a major contribution to regional air pollution they affect public health and the economy accurate monitoring of global aerosols thus has significant societal and environmental benefits to improve global aerosol representation an ensemble based global aerosol data assimilation da system has been developed at noa by ""optimally"" combining information from aerosol observations and model outputs due to large aerosol model uncertainty and limited temporal and or spatial coverage of aerosol observations continuous global aerosol reanalysis produced through da plays an essential role in understanding aerosol characteristics and its impact on weather climate and air quality here we propose to produce a five year global aerosol reanalysis for t2018 2022 as an extension of our currently funded project of ""joint noaa nasa development of a data assimilation system for aerosol reanalysis and forecasting"" na18oar4310281 2018 2021 specifically the global aerosol reanalysis datasets will be produced by a using the noa united forecast system ufs aerosols coupled with nasa's second generation goddard chemistry aerosol radiation and transport gocart parameterization that includes nitrate aerosols b leveraging three dimensional ensemble variational 3denvar application with the local ensemble transform kalman filter letkf for ensemble update in the joint efforts for data assimilation jedi for aerosol assimilation c assimilating aerosol optical depth aod retrievals at 550 nm derived from the visible infrared imaging radiometer suite viirs instruments onboard noaa's satellites and d verifying against independent ground and satellite based aerosol observations and aerosol reanalysis following ncep emc's metrics","Environmental Modeling Center (EMC)","CIRES/University of Colorado","<img src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PART-WPO/SPARK/refs/heads/main/icons/all-tp.PNG"" alt=""All Hazards"" />","https://part-wpo.github.io/reach-dashboard/?award=NA22OAR4590219","To produce a long-term global aerosol reanalysis product at NOAA in support of climate monitoring and prediction."

substantially to the western U.S. water supply but also cause damaging floods. Therefore, a seasonal outlook for AR activity would benefit a wide range of stakeholders, but the NOAA Climate Prediction Center (CPC) currently does not provide seasonal outlooks explicitly tied to the extreme conditions produced by ARs. A recent study led by Collaborator Tseng and supervised by Co-PI Johnson (Tseng et al. 2021) demonstrates that the Seamless System for Prediction and EArth System Research (SPEAR), the latest seasonal prediction model developed at GFDL and a contributor to the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME), produces skillful seasonal (three-month) forecasts of AR activity out to at least 9 months in some regions of the western U.S. Therefore, these research developments indicate a promising opportunity to develop a new operational seasonal AR forecast
product for NOAA CPC.
The proposed project aims to develop an NMME-based seasonal AR guidance for NOAA CPC that would be ready for transition into operations. This product would complement the experimental
subseasonal AR forecast product that CPC recently developed, increasing NOAA's ability to provide seamless forecasts of AR activity across subseasonal to seasonal timescales. The initial focus will be placed on the refinement of the SPEAR-based seasonal AR outlook, with subsequent efforts devoted
to a multi-model NMME seasonal AR product. Forecast performance will be evaluated with established verification metrics in both retrospective forecasts and in a real-time experimental test
environment in coordination with the Climate Testbed. The expected outcomes are (1) a prototype seasonal AR forecast product over the U.S., including probabilistic forecasts of AR activity and associated extreme precipitation, that is utilized internally by CPC forecasters; (2) a comprehensive
diagnosis of the expected forecast performance of this product; and (3) an evaluation of model postprocessing methods, including those of model calibration and optimal model weighting, that
potentially can be applied in other research-to-operations efforts.","The primary project outputs include an NMME-based seasonal AR forecast tool for CPC forecasters, publicly available seasonal AR forecast guidance, journal article publications, and presentations in webinars and conferences, as described below.","CPC","Wassila Thiaw","National Center for Atmospheric Research

is to provide users with rapidly-updating probabilistic hazard information (PHI) across the
lifecycle of a weather event. An important tool for accomplishing this goal is skillful automated
PHI, which increases forecasters' situational awareness and aids their ability to provide timely
severe weather threat guidance to the public. Scientists have developed observation-based PHI at
the warning scale (i.e., ~30 min. prior to hazardous weather) and high-resolution numerical
weather prediction (NWP) PHI at the watch scale (i.e., several hours prior to hazardous weather).
However, blended PHI that specifically targets the prediction of severe weather between watch
and warning scales using both observational and NWP information has not yet been created. To
that end, this project proposes to develop, evaluate, and iteratively improve automated
severe weather PHI that provides guidance from 3 hours to 30 minutes ahead of a severe
weather event using observational and NWP data.","This project will result in the development of real-time PHI based on combined information
from the PHI Tool (including ProbSevere and PHItor) and WoFS. The combined severe weather
PHI will aid in the production of more continuous and rapidly-updating severe weather hazard
probabilities, which will support NOAA in meeting its goal of providing more timely and effective
severe weather warnings. An important output of this project will be the real-time availability of
combined severe weather PHI on a publicly-accessible website for viewing by NWS forecasters
and other interested users. Documentation of the ML-derived combined severe weather PHI, its
objective and subjective performance, best practices for operational use, and application to short-
term severe weather predictability challenges will be provided in two peer-reviewed journal
articles and shared at professional conferences. If the COVID-19 pandemic prevents in-person

weather forecasts compared to existing methods, this proposal aims to produce and validate
medium-range convective forecast guidance provided by both a CAM ensemble and ML
algorithms, focusing on convective mode and severe weather hazards. Specifically, the proposed
work will 1) produce real-time 8-day, 10-member CAM ensemble forecasts with 3-km horizontal
grid spacing over the conterminous United States using a variable-resolution global NWP model
based on the Finite-Volume Cubed-Sphere (FV3) dynamic core; 2) apply ML to improve raw
CAM forecasts of convective mode and hazards through the entire 8-day forecast period; 3)
explore forecasts from time-lagged CAM ensembles; 4) objectively validate forecasts to quantify
how skill and reliability of severe weather forecasts change with spatial scale and lead-time; and
5) provide real-time forecasts to NOAA's 2023-2025 Hazardous Weather Tested (HWT) Spring
Forecasting Experiments (SFEs), representing the first time that medium-range CAM ensemble
forecasts are subjectively evaluated by HWT SFE participants.","Several outputs and products will be designed, tested, and transferred during the project.
Specifically, the model configurations, variable-resolution global grid, and workflow used to
produce the FV3-based CAM ensemble forecasts will be implemented into the Unified Forecast

A serious limitation of the current operational uncertainty products is that the underlying probabilities are derived from historical forecast error distributions. We propose to adapt a new
machine learning method developed by Dr. Elizabeth Barnes and collaborators to estimate TC
track and intensity forecast error uncertainty using an abstention neural network technique based
on a multi-model ensemble and TC environmental parameters. A fundamental difference
between this approach, referred to as the Tropical Cyclone Abstention Network (TCAN)
model, and existing operational techniques is that the uncertainty estimates are obtained as
part of the network training, rather than from post-analysis of forecast errors. TCAN builds
on the NHC's operational Neural Network Intensity Consensus (NNIC) model and predicts the
full conditional distributions of track and intensity that depend on the specific forecast situation.
TCAN has been developed for NHC and CPHC, is compatible with the existing NHC's operational
environment, and will be demonstrated in real-time, in close coordination with the Joint
Hurricane Testbed (JHT). TCAN will be also adapted to the western North Pacific for JTWC.","The TCAN guidance on guidance model will produce track and
intensity forecasts and measures of uncertainty based on the conditional distributions predicted by the neural networks. Special emphasis will be placed on testing in JHT all components of the system, including the database development, model training, forecast components, product generation, and validation to maximize the prospects for operational transition if the project is successful. Past criticism of the use of neural networks for forecasting was that they are ""black boxes"", but methods now exist to help explain the network's decision. The products will also include output from explainable artificial intelligence (AI) methods to provide forecasters with
information about which aspects of the TCAN input were most relevant for its prediction.","NHC","Wallace Hogsett - wallace.hogsett@noaa.gov

In turn, this would allow NHC to develop observation strategies that could address uncertainty in forecasts of societal-based impacts, such
was wind and precipitation.

Building on the detailed work that went into the preparation of the APAR Technical Requirements Document (TRD) and MP2 documents, EOL has selected four critical tasks that will have major positive impacts on clarifying the radar system design and reducing several risks identified in the development plans. Tasks include: i) an industry Trade Study to address specific technical questions about the APAR design; ii) an end-to-end demonstration of integrated antenna, transceiver, digital receiver, and radar control
and processing software; iii) an airframe vibration characterization of the NSF/NCAR C-130; and iv) a model simulation and evaluation of sampling performance of C-band active electronically scanned area (AESA) antennas using a prototype APAR Observation Simulator (AOS). EOL will utilize in-house expertise, experienced external consultants, and aerospace industry specialists to complete the proposed tasks. The outcome of these activities will allow EOL to refine technical requirements, identify and address known risks, and implement mitigation strategies in the focused design phase.

for a coordinated effort among the states of Alabama, Georgia and Florida to
materially enhance the soil moisture network in the Southeast and to improve
applications of these data by (1) expanding the network throughout the three states,
(2) establishing test beds for assessing new designs for low-cost sensors, (3)
updating and adding to agricultural models to improve the detection of stress
indices such as the wilting point - the time at which SE agricultural losses began to
accrue, (4) calibrating and testing current and new remote-sensing techniques so as
to provide complete three-state coverage of drought stress and flood indices, (5)
developing tools to provide conformity and utility of soil moisture data and their
derived products, and (6) provide a publicly-accessible platform for product
distribution.","Specific Outcomes - Expanding the soil moisture sensor network in Alabama will have a direct
impact on observations this vital metric which will be used to improve existing models and
remote sensing products. The products will better-define the magnitude of soil-moisture and
vegetative stresses across the SE for application in (a) agricultural operations, (b) determination
of real-time agricultural drought stress, (c) general scientific research involving the
land/atmosphere interface and (d) defining levels for federal assistance payments to those who
suffer economic losses. Our products will be available to support NIDIS and other NOAA
drought activities.
Broader Outcomes - Creating a database of soil moisture sensors that can be included in the
National Soil Moisture Network will contribute to collaborative research and applications across
the country in an immediate sense as the fundamental measurements here will be the same as
those reported in the nation-wide USCRN and USDA SCAN stations. Increasing the accuracy of
Remote sensing, model and gridded products through additional in situ soil moisture monitoring
will have a broader benefit of contributing to a better understanding of the hydrological cycle.
Societal Outcomes - Improving forecasts and drought designations can have large societal
impacts. Communities can build in resilience and plan for mitigation of extreme events. Public
water supplies could define and implement drought plans based on accurate forecasts. Farmers
and producers could determine what level of water storage and irrigation infrastructure is needed
and affordable to offset the damage from a given that flash droughts will occur. Much of the
government's response to a drought disaster is dependent on defining the extent and duration of
the drought, thus a more accurate and objective depiction of crop stress is a fundamental
advancement for the legislated activity that assists farmers","OWP","N/A","University of Alabama in Huntsville","NA20OAR4590495","Water Extremes","Alabama","Christy","","2020","October 2020 - September 2023","<span class=""material-icons status-icon complete"" title=""Complete"">check_circle</span>","Dynamics and Nesting, In-situ Observation Technologies and Sensors, Satellite & Remote Sensing Technologies, Surface Observing Networks, Decision Support","developing new soil moisture technologies and applications for improving assessments and forecasts of water issues in the southeast such as flash droughts floods and ecosystem health alabama phase, to enhance materially the soil moisture network in the southeast and to improve applications of these data through a tri state research effort and to further improves forecasting extreme weather events such as flash floods and flash droughts, this project is the alabama contribution of a three state proposal seeking funding for a coordinated effort among the states of alabama georgia and florida to materially enhance the soil moisture network in the southeast and to improve applications of these data by 1 expanding the network throughout the three states 2 establishing test beds for assessing new designs for low cost sensors 3 updating and adding to agricultural models to improve the detection of stress indices such as the wilting point - the time at which se agricultural losses began to accrue 4 calibrating and testing current and new remote sensing techniques so as to provide complete three state coverage of drought stress and flood indices 5 developing tools to provide conformity and utility of soil moisture data and their derived products and 6 provide a publicly accessible platform for product distribution","NWS Office of Water Prediction (OWP)","University of Alabama in Huntsville","<img src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PART-WPO/SPARK/refs/heads/main/icons/flooding-tp.png"" alt=""Water Extremes"" />","https://part-wpo.github.io/reach-dashboard/?award=NA20OAR4590495","To enhance materially the soil moisture network in the Southeast and to improve applications of these data through a tri-state research effort, and to further improves forecasting extreme weather events such as flash floods and"

more complete real-time knowledge of atmospheric and oceanic conditions and more realistic
representation of key physical processes in hurricane forecast models. This proposal seeks to
address these needs through the deployment of Uncrewed Surface Vehicle (USV) saildrones
during the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season. Powered by renewable energy (wind and solar),
the USV saildrones are larger (7 m long, more than 220 lb payload capacity), faster (3-5 kt on
average) and have longer endurance (8-12 months science mission) than most other marine
Uncrewed Systems (UxS). A new development is the specially designed reinforced saildrones
that can sustain hurricane force wind and high seas. In this project, the uncrewed autonomous
marine system will continuously measure the near-surface atmosphere (temperature, humidity, 3-
dimensional wind, solar and longwave radiation, and pressure) and upper ocean (sea surface
temperature and salinity, surface and subsurface ocean currents, surface wave height and period),
with goals to transmit the observations in real-time to GTS and assimilate into NOAA's
operational hurricane forecast models. The saildrones will follow tracks in the western tropical
Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, regions with high hurricane track densities and high probability of
storm development. They will be navigated to systematically collect observations ahead of and
inside of storms of interest by repeating tracks. The proposed saildrone measurements will be
coordinated with NOAA's operational hurricane field programs that have been providing
invaluable observations. Planned coordination with underwater glider observations will provide
the first collocated measurements of the upper ocean and atmosphere from uncrewed vehicles
during hurricane events. In addition, analysis will be conducted to quantify air-sea heat and
momentum fluxes, assess hurricane model errors, improve model parameterizations, and
determine the value of saildrone observations for data assimilation and prediction. The proposed
saildrones will serve as a proof of concept for making regular autonomous measurements across
the air-sea interface during the hurricane season. The cross-line office (OAR, NWS) commitment
to the proposal illustrates the significant value the proposed measurements would likely bring to
NOAA and the high potential for transitioning to routine operations. This project is directly
related to the WPO ""Observations"" program, specifically ""UxS and expendables."" It also
addresses key priorities of the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017, by
""identifying data gaps in observing capabilities and determining a range of options to address

(NCPA) at the University of Mississippi (UM) under contract to NOAA (Infrasound Detection of Tornadoes FY2017 and FY2018) has shown that in every case in which a tornado
was in a location for which propagation conditions suggested that an infrasonic signal from
that tornado would be detected on a deployed array it was. Detections were in the 2 to
8 Hz band. Analysis of storms that did not produce tornadoes showed that only lightning
(that can easily be distinguished from tornadoes) and static anthropomorphic sources (again
easily identifiable as such) produced detections in the 2 to 8 Hz band. Further, in cases in
which ground truth tornado tracks are available, back azimuths from the tornado detections coincide with the directions from the detecting array to the tornado tracks. We are
convinced that, in cases in which a tornado is detected on multiple arrays a tornado track
can be determined. If true, this could provide automated tornado detection and tracking
capability, albeit subject to the time delays (about three seconds per kilometer) inherent in
acoustic propagation. It is our goal, in this project, to install a prototype detection network
of infrasound sensing arrays to the hypothesis that infrasound detection could be a practical
tool for tornado hazard monitoring. Currently, the approach is to use the crudest information from the infrasonic signal: detection of the signal. Work completed under contract
to NOAA (contract NA19OAR4590339) on identifying the physical mechanism underlying
these infrasonic emissions will continue. An understanding of the elements of a tornado that
cause the emission of infrasound will inform future data analysis and could lead to methods

uncertainty is the snowpack-precipitation feedback, which alters precipitation characteristics over
timescales of days to months. However, the impacts of snowpack-precipitation feedbacks on S2S
predictions of precipitation and drought in the NOAA UFS have not been thoroughly assessed and
quantified. Moreover, S2S snowpack modeling in Noah-MP, a land component of NOAA UFS,
still suffers from large biases. This leads to crucial deficiencies in representing land-atmosphere

be simulated accurately to issue reliable subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) forecast guidance.
Unfortunately, systematic model errors, both in the representation of tropical variability and the
extratropical background state through which teleconnections propagate, consistently limit our
ability to issue skillful S2S guidance. This proposal will identify how model bias and forecast error
associated with the simulation of specific dynamical modes of climate variability in the Unified
Forecast System (UFS) degrade forecasts of temperature and precipitation events over the CONUS
on subseasonal timescales. We seek to answer two fundamental questions: 1) to what extent could
weeks 2-6 CONUS precipitation and 2m temperature forecasts become more skillful by improving
the UFS representation potentially predictable forms of tropical subseasonal variability; and 2)
what are the relative contributions of tropical error sources and extratropical model biases for
degrading CONUS subseasonal precipitation and 2m temperature forecast skill?
We propose to answer these questions via a novel approach merging machine learning
techniques (developed at NOAA PSL) with nudged hindcast experiments conducted using research
and prototype versions of the UFS. We will employ a machine learning technique called a linear
inverse model (LIM), which can be used both as a subseasonal forecast model and as a dynamical
filter that isolates specific dynamical modes of climate variability. We have already constructed
LIMs with subseasonal forecast skill comparable to current ECMWF and NCEP operational
models (at and beyond 3-week forecast leads), and used the LIM as a dynamical filter to identify
the MJO, ENSO, stratospheric processes, and other modes of atmospheric internal variability.
Merging these two aspects of the LIM with the UFS will allow us to (1) establish a upper bound
on the downstream CONUS forecast skill that might be realized if each individual, tropicallybased, dynamical mode was perfectly simulated in the UFS, and (2) quantify how the inaccurate
simulation of these dynamical modes by the current generation UFS causes errors and biases that
degrade CONUS forecast skill.","Operational subseasonal forecasters regularly utilize information about process-based sources of forecast skill. For example, during the weekly operational CPC weeks 3-4 forecast discussions, the MJO RMM index and ENSO forecasts (via the CPC multiple linear regression tool) are reviewed to infer sources of predictability. Thus, our work will help forecasters understand the errors and biases inherent to key subseasonal forecasting predictors. In addition, a dynamical process-based filter will inform which model improvements will yield the most return on investment. For example, properly simulating the QBO requires significant investments in tuning gravity wave schemes (Bushell et al. 2020) and substantial computational resources due to the high vertical resolutions required (Holt et al. 2020, Richter et al. 2020). Given limited resources to
improve and run the models, does fixing the QBO yield the best return on investment versus improving atmosphere-ocean coupling (ENSO) or convective processes (MJO)? Our proposal therefore directly addresses S2S Competition Goal 2: To improve model capabilities, it is crucial to identify and address sources of model bias across NOAA's modeling suite.

These eigenfunctions provide the basis for a reduced-order representation, specifically for coupled atmosphere-ocean dynamics, of the key probability distributions related to subseasonal variability that would otherwise need to be estimated using a very large ensemble forecast. Unlike the typical perturbations used for medium-range ensembles, which emphasize mid-latitude synoptic and sub-synoptic variability, these perturbations form a compact representation of the forecast probability distribution itself as it evolves in time. One of the most exciting features of this finding is that these eigenfunctions are not simply theoretical idealized structures, but can be estimated directly from data by using an algorithm called dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), which is closely related to the Linear Inverse Model (LIM) already being used experimentally for prediction at the NOAA Climate Prediction Center (CPC). To date, we have demonstrated this method using a low-order coupled atmosphere-ocean quasi-geostrophic (QG) model. The proposed project will determine the potential for this approach in a more realistic setting by scaling to higher resolutions, introducing model errors, and then testing its effectiveness when applied to the NOAA Unified Forecast System (UFS) coupled model. Practical aspects of applying the method in an operational context will be investigated by incorporating this approach in a simplified cycled coupled data assimilation application, first with the coupled QG model and then with a low-resolution UFS coupled model. This activity supports NOAA by addressing the need for initialization methods for the NOAA UFS coupled model, specifically for forecasts targeting subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) timescales. The outcome of this work will be a proof-of-concept and evaluation of the proposed initialization technique applied to the UFS at low resolutions, comparing the forecast skill using conventional initialization versus using a projection onto the approximate KM and PF eigenfunctions. The methods and outcomes of this work will be described in detail in published peer-reviewed journal articles. This work will validate the approach and prepare prototype software for a future transition to operational-scale testing and implementation, where the ultimate goal is to improve the performance of operational S2S forecasts provided by NOAA to the general public.","A comprehensive initialization strategy for the Unified Forecast System (UFS) coupled atmosphere-ocean numerical forecast model will ultimately improve forecast capabilities at S2S time scales that will better inform all public and private sector decision makers that require information at these lead times.","N/A","N/A","Sofar Ocean Technologies, NOAA CPC, RMI-Belgium","NA23OAR4590196,

In particular, the Alaskan coastal region is frequently affected by strong cyclones over the Gulf of Alaska, the Bering Sea, and the Chukchi Sea. Thus it is important for many stakeholders, including emergency management, water resource management, transportation, and utilities, to name a few, to be warned of approaching periods of increased or decreased potential of storm activities. While individual cyclone tracks can be predicted out to about a week or so, from week 2 on, individual tracks become less predictable, and statistics summarizing cyclone activity, or storminess, are more useful instead. Currently, NOAA Climate Prediction Center (CPC) does not provide guidance on subseasonal variability of storminess. Recent studies by the PIs have shown that NCEP CFS and GEFS ensemble forecasts exhibit significant skills in predicting subseasonal variability of storminess in the Alaska region. This project will extend results from these studies to develop and further assess subseasonal storminess guidance products for the Alaska region. 
Storminess can be defined based on Lagrangian cyclone tracking or by Eulerian variance statistics. We propose using a combination of both methods. Lagrangian cyclone tracks provide information about where cyclones pass through and is more intuitive to users, while Eulerian variance statistics has been shown to be more predictable and highly correlated with cyclone related weather. Forecast tracks can be displayed on maps while track statistics (frequency, amplitude, accumulated cyclone track activity which is a combination of track frequency and amplitude) can be accumulated at each grid point to more quantitatively assess variations in cyclone activity. We will also make use of sea level pressure variance which can be computed at each grid point as a complementary metric to quantify cyclone activity. Cyclone related weather impacts (precipitation and high wind anomalies) will be extracted from the forecast ensemble to inform stakeholders of the potential impacts of the predicted storminess variations. These statistically post-processed model predictions will be fully assessed by comparing model hindcasts with observations. The developed tools will be tested for near real-time monitoring and forecast. A publicly accessible web page will be developed to display the subseasonal predictions in real time. The web page will also contain climatological information as well as information on forecast verification to enable users to make more informed use of the forecasts.","Hydrometeorological extremes threaten our interconnected food, water, and energy security and currently cause hundreds of deaths and billions of US dollars in damage annually. Improving our predictions of such events at subseasonal timescales of weeks 2-5 offers an opportunity to enhance our early warning planning to minimize extreme event impacts. We propose to improve the UFS land model and land-atmosphere interactions to improve precipitation and surface hydrology (snowpack, near surface soil moisture, and streamflow) forecasts across the Western US at the weeks 2-5 subseasonal scale. We will do this by leveraging novel statistical evaluation, model optimization techniques and the Hierarchical System Development (HSD) paradigm for the UFS. Thus, our proposal responds to the Innovations for Community Modeling - Priority Area II: Western States Hydrology, S2SIC-1: 'Community-based approaches to improve Earth system models via development and evaluation of individual model components and coupling within the community-based UFS S2S prototypes crucial for improved prediction of western states hydrometeorology.' Our primary products will consist of peer-reviewed publications, method documentation, guidance and evaluation presentations to NOAA/NWS/NCEP/EMC and the scientific community, and public releases of data and analysis code. Our publications will document process level coupling biases within and between Noah-Multiparameterization (Noah-MP) and the atmospheric model, with connections back to forecast errors for UFS S2S configurations; and describe our Noah-MP optimization methodology. We will document Noah-MP configurations and their performance across increasing model complexity ranging from land-only to regional land-atmosphere reforecast simulations; release Noah-MP model improvements and other project code to GitHub; and release regional reforecast datasets generated during the project on the NCAR Research Data Archive. Finally, we will provide recommendations on Noah-MP configurations and enhancements to NCEP/EMC. This project will impact the greater weather and land modeling enterprise. We expect to demonstrate improvements to UFS subseasonal precipitation (primarily spring and summer precipitation) and year-round hydrology forecast skill across the Western US. We will also demonstrate deeper process level understanding within Noah-MP and land-atmosphere coupling, including improved understanding of causality within the coupled model, that is, answering 'why?'. The primary target for the forecast innovations is the NOAA/NWS/NCEP/EMC land group, with Noah-MP improvements advancing the greater land-modeling community. Improved weeks 2-5 UFS forecast skill benefits the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) and all users of NOAA forecasts, bettering the nation's economy and individual's livelihoods. More broadly, our publicly available code, documentation, and reforecast datasets will be readily adoptable by the UFS community. Our methods are applicable to other parts of the UFS (e.g., diagnosing process coupling biases and causality within the atmospheric model). We also plan to work with the METplus team to identify future hydrologic, land-atmosphere coupling, and additional information theory metric implementation into METplus.

Accurate predictions of these events at subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) scale have far reaching implications for water management over these regions, and yet have been challenging to attain. Of the many contributors to the lack of S2S forecast skills, inadequacy in the representation of surface conditions by land surface models (LSMs), as well as its downstream impacts, have yet to gain adequate attention. Past research by the project team on Noah-MP, the designated LSM for UFS, has underscored several critical deficiencies, including artificially fast snow sublimation and melt, and timing errors in the seasonal cycle in vegetation phenology and soil water uptake. The former leads to persistent underestimation of snowpack, and the latter distorts root-zone soil moisture dynamics, evapotranspiration, and moisture recycling. In aggregate, these limitations may hinder the ability of coupled models to realistically capture the land-atmospheric interactions and thereby limit their skills to predict hydrometeorological extremes at the S2S range. The overarching goals of the proposed project are threefold. The first is to introduce enhancements to Noah-MP to remedy the key deficiencies of Noah-MP LSM identified by the UTA team. The second is to develop a novel, machine-learning based, prognostic LAI forecast model which can be two-way interactive with UFS forecast model in lieu of UFS prescribed static LAI distributions (not changing between years) or dynamic vegetation model. The third is to discern the individual and aggregate impacts of these enhancements on the skills of UFS S2S model for predicting major hydrometerological events over the western US.","The proposed initiative will benefit NOAA and water enterprise over the western US in the following respects. First, the introduction of new snow parameterization schemes has the potential to improve S2S forecasts of snowpack, and springtime runoff for states heavily reliant on snowmelt runoff. Second, the hindcast experiments, to be conducted for two recent episodes for which operational models performed poorly, will help determine the predictability of these events that can be gleaned through the improvements. The outcome will guide the official configuration of the UFS S2S forecast system, and any improvements to S2S forecasts will ultimately contribute to proactive water resources planning.","N/A","N/A","University of Texas Arlington,

A major obstacle in this regard, however, is the inability of current operational models to faithfully capture known sources of potential prediction skill. These sources include the 30-60-day Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), whose poor simulation in the NOAA Global Forecast System version 15 (GFSv15) has been linked to errors in that model's forecasts of precipitation along the US West Coast at Weeks 3-4. Here we propose to address this issue in the context of the next- generation NOAA Global Ensemble Forecast System version 13 (GEFSv13), which is currently under development and will be a fully coupled atmosphere-ocean model, unlike its predecessor. The idea is to take advantage of the ""replay"" capability of the model, which enables a relatively inexpensive form of cycled data assimilation, where the analysis increments are calculated as the difference between the model's first-guess (6-hr) forecast and a given reanalysis product. The innovation will be to use the analysis increments to guide targeted refinements in the treatment of unresolved moist processes that minimize the model's short-term MJO prediction errors. Specific processes that will be targeted include the evaporation of convective rain unsaturated air, as well as the entrainment of unsaturated air in convective updrafts, both of which are important for determining how convection and moisture interact with one another. Completion of this model optimization step will set the stage for more standard S2S hindcast experiments, to evaluate impacts on coupled predictions of the MJO and its associated teleconnection patterns affecting US West Coast precipitation at Weeks 3-4. The proposal fits well within the scope of the Western States Hydrology Program of the FY23 NOAA/OAR/WPO Innovations for Community Modeling Competition. In particular, by using analysis increments to advance S2S predictions of western states precipitation through the targeted process-level improvement of the MJO in the prototype coupled GEFS, the project will ""identify and address the sources of model biases"" in order to ""better harness predictability sources"" that are ""most relevant in the Western States Hydrology program"". The total requested funds for the project are $581,354.00, which will provide partial salary support for two university research scientists.","The main question that will be addressed in this final stage of the project is whether the steps
taken in Stage 2 to optimize the GEFSv13 in terms of its first-guess MJO prediction skill lead to
any tangible benefits at longer leads, including in terms of predicting precipitation patterns over
the western US at Weeks 3-4? To address this question, we will use the optimized version of the
model to repeat the 35-day ensemble hindcast integrations of the MJO from Stage 1. Changes in
model performance will be assessed using not only measures of skill relevant to the Western
States Hydrology Program, but also those of more general importance, such as the 500-mb
anomaly pattern correlation in the midlatitudes. In cases where results are negative, we will look
at when problems first start to develop and try to relate these problems back to changes in the
physics that were seen to be beneficial at the start of the hindcast. Regardless of the outcome, we
believe that the findings of this innovative project will serve to identify best practices for
improving the next-generation coupled UFS in terms of its ability to simulate known sources of
S2S prediction skill.","N/A","N/A","CIRES/University of Colorado Boulder,

coupled MOM6-SIS2 ocean modeling system. We propose to run the MOM6-SIS2 system to simulate the joint atmospherically- and tidally-forced ocean circulation, and then refine the resolution
of this system to create skillfully accurate predictions of the barotropic and low-mode baroclinic
tides. Our targeted horizontal grid, a nominal (1/48)-degree tripolar grid, is chosen to capture the
topographic gradients responsible for generating the low-mode baroclinic tides. While this system
represents the state-of-the-art among global modeling components for Earth system prediction, future progress in computing capabilities, numerical methods, and subgrid-scale parameterizations
will supersede MOM6-SIS2 with more capable systems. Our goal is to implement a methodology
for calibrating the resolution-dependent parameterizations of MOM6-SIS2 to yield accurate predictions of barotropic and baroclinic tides, and to enable the efficient calibration of future systems
after MOM6-SIS2 becomes obsolete.","This project has the potential to make significant impacts across the oceanographic research community. For example, in the coming ""SWOT era"" - in which swath observations of ocean surface topography become available for synergistic combination with other high-resolution ocean observations - high-resolution global ocean simulations will be used to plan new satellite missions, generate testable hypotheses concerning climate dynamics, and envision future scenarios. Simulations with the proposed MOM6-SIS2 system can provide boundary conditions to regional ocean forecast systems developed by the U.S. Navy and other end-users. The funded and unfunded collaborators of this project are ideally positioned to integrate the project outcomes throughout the research community.","N/A","N/A","Oregon State University,

For S2S time scales, LIMs are typically constructed from weekly anomalies of various atmospheric and oceanic quantities. While LIMs do not capture predictable nonlinearities, they do effectively represent other predictable dynamics, which allows LIM hindcast skill to be comparable (sometimes better, sometimes worse) to that of more sophisticated numerical models. Consequently, LIMs have been used extensively for predictability studies, to benchmark other forecast guidance (e.g., CGCM forecasts), and to make near real-time forecasts, which have been run in real-time experimental mode at PSD.

that has been of increasing concern in a warming and more variable precipitation climate in the
watersheds of the western US. A significant proportion of the western United States'
population, ecosystems, and agricultural activities relies on snowpack to provide water
resources. Further, there are large areas at risk for snowmelt flooding. There are two types of
snow drought. The first type, dry snow drought, occurs when both precipitation and snowpack
are below normal; precipitation is suppressed due to atmospheric conditions. The other type is
warm snow drought. Warm snow droughts occur when accumulated cold season precipitation
is near normal or above normal, but snow water equivalent (SWE) is well below normal. Such
conditions result from above-normal temperatures and mountain precipitation falling as rain
rather than snow or from mid-winter melt events driven by anomalous warm spells. Snow
drought conditions of either type have implications for water resource and flood management,
as well as recreation and ecosystems. Tracking snow drought conditions in real-time,
specifically warm snow drought, would be beneficial to the NWS and its stakeholders at the
federal, state, and local levels.","Provide extended lead-time information and Impact-based Decision Support Services for

The science challenge is that we do not know what the predictive skill is for lead times beyond a few days for relevant wind and wave fields available from operational ensemble modeling systems.  The proposed future capability is for an oceanic hazards outlook containing delineations of where winds and waves are expected to have the potential of posing a hazard to either life or property for vessels at sea.

A skill assessment, comprised of reforecasts of the GEFS with the WAVEWATCH III model, will be required for a period over the last 15 to 20 years.  The model reanalysis will require high temporal frequency.  Through data mining, if there is sufficient skill, tools would be developed for forecasters to provide mariners with information on the potential for significant winds and wave heights that would be detrimental to the safety of life at sea.  Development of the tools would employ advanced neural-networks and artificial intelligence methods.  Vessels traversing the north Atlantic and north Pacific Oceans can take 21 days to navigate between distant ports.  Critical economic and life-saving decisions can be made with great situational awareness of upcoming hazards.  This would enhance total marine weather services to the private sector, the public and the global community ultimately advancing America's blue economy.","This will include building an inventory of existing applications of probabilistic forecasts in guidance and ocean hazards forecast support.

These high, and in some cases extreme, wind events drive rapid wildfire spread on new or existing fires and can generate extreme wildfire behavior. While the wind events themselves are typically forecasted quite well by the NWS, there is no climatological context to provide information on just how severe a forecasted event might be relative to historical events. A downslope wind climatology would be beneficial for communicating the severity of an upcoming event to forecasters, media, wildfire agencies, and the public.


In addition to the wildfire community, a high-resolution wind climatology product will also benefit other sectors such as transportation, energy, and recreation. For example, winter storm winds can have significant impacts on the lee side of mountain ranges.  This product would help with messaging for major wind events in general, by putting wind speeds into a proper climatological context for overall general safety and protection of lives and property.","(FY22Q4) - Have an initial meeting with NWS partners to learn about specific metrics of interest that should be calculated for downslope winds and communication of the associated hazards.

Critical economic and life-saving decisions can be made with reliable situational awareness of likely winds and wave hazards to include: informing long-range routing for optimal fuel savings; supply chain reliability with on time for the delivery of goods; and avoiding dangerous seas that can lead to loss of life and property and potentially even costly environmental disasters (note; there are ~100 hurricane-force wind events on average each year between the north Atlantic and Pacific oceans, some building seas to greater than 50ft).

However, these well-established relationships almost completely break down in late-summer to mid-fall (August-October; ASO). Thus, operational seasonal forecast models have generally low skill in ASO for U.S. regional precipitation, leaving a large portion of U.S. populations vulnerable to unpredictable extreme events in that season. Our recent study (Kim et al., 2020) identified key physical processes in the Atlantic and Pacific that directly modulate late-summer to mid-fall U.S. precipitation variability, and demonstrated these connections using observations, a fully coupled model and a series of simple atmospheric model experiments. The study showed that in ASO, the inter-basin contrast between Pacific and Atlantic SSTAs significantly influences convective activity over the Caribbean Sea; this regional change in convection directly modulates the strength of the North American Low-Level Jet, and thus drives U.S. precipitation variability east of the Rockies. Through this mechanism, inter-basin SSTA contrast and Caribbean Sea convective activity could serve as potential predictors for U.S. late-summer to mid-fall precipitation. We propose to develop a seasonal forecast system for U.S. regional precipitation, targeting the ASO season, based on this newly identified mechanism. We also propose a new optimized hybrid forecast system that combines dynamic and empirical models to maximize the forecast skill. Our proposal addresses the U.S. rainfall prediction gap in late-summer to mid-fall through the innovative applications of inter-basin SST and convection parameters in a novel optimized hybrid seasonal forecast system. This proposal is therefore highly relevant to the OAR/WPO call for ""Innovative Research for the Precipitation Prediction Grand Challenge"". This project explores the use of machine learning.","U.S. precipitation variability and associated hazardous weather events such as floods, droughts, severe thunderstorms and deadly heat waves exert a range of significant socio-economic impacts. Previous studies have extensively studied large-scale climate processes that are linked to U.S. precipitation variability. For instance, El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) significantly modulates late-fall to mid-spring (November-April) precipitation over the U.S. through the associated extratropical Rossby wave propagations to North America. However, in late-spring to mid-fall (May-October), ENSO-induced extratropical atmospheric teleconnection is relatively weak, thus playing a minor role in U.S. precipitation variability. For this reason, the seasonal prediction skill for U.S. precipitation is relatively poor in the warm season compared to the cold season. Our proposal addresses the U.S. rainfall prediction gap in late-summer to mid-fall through the innovative applications of inter-basin SST and convection parameters in a novel optimized hybrid seasonal forecast system, which make our proposal both innovative and significant.","N/A","N/A","NOAA/OAR/AOML,

The related research question is, ""Does infrasound provide a viable and dependable method of direct tornado detection?""","The proposed research initiative focuses on field observations and data analysis to increase
understanding and characterization of infrasound emissions from tornadoes. The importance of timely damage surveys cannot be understated since the damage surveys will be used to determine the tornado formation and dissipation points and times, tornado intensity (EF scale), and damage path width.
The operational outputs of this initiative include the following:
 Development of an initial test bed, anchored at Severe Weather Institute Radar and Lightning Laboratories (SWIRLL), to be used in subsequent years to
continue a more detailed evaluation of IS direct detection of tornadoes, and
 A real-time display of infrasound emissions, from the permanent IS array at SWIRLL (at a
minimum) over the VORTEX-SE (VSE) operational domain.
The research team will also evaluate and provide a preliminary assessment of the following:
 Efficiency of IS for detection of tornadoes, and accuracy of IS in tornado detection based
on data collected during the first year,
 Effective range of IS detection and the dependence on tornado intensity,
 Feasibility of IS to quantify tornado characteristics, such as EF-scale and width of damage
track, and
 Efficacy of using IS detection capabilities, particularly when combined and validated with
dual-pol radar direct detection, to develop near real-time displays of tornado paths.

2) A WoF system will provide ensemble information on the near-storm environment within TCs, including locally favorable regions for tornado development (e.g. Knupp et al. 2006; Green et al. 2011), which can help forecasters rapidly prioritizing storms within a broad region of tornado potential.

This work will (1) produce 3-km emissions based on NEI2016 and NEI2020 over NW US and NE US, respectively; (2) generate an offline RRFS-CMAQ with consistent physics, chemistry, and aerosol representations with the inline RRFS-CMAQ; (3) contribute to the updated inline RRFS-CMAQ with improved O3 and PM2.5 forecasting skills at a Readiness Level (RL) 8 for R2O transition; (4) demonstrate the applications of inline RRFS-CMAQ at 13- and 3-km resolutions for FIREX-AQ 2019 and AEROMMA 2023. The methodology for high resolution emission generation can be generalized to produce model ready emissions over the CONUS at 3-km or finer. The offline RRFS-CMAQ will be a useful system to benchmark the inline RRFS-CMAQ to facilitate its development and improvement and to demonstrate its benefits of the coupled weather-air quality modeling for NOAA NAQFC team and the community users. The O3 and PM2.5 forecasts at 3-km over NW US and NE US can be used to assess their health impacts at a fine scale and analyze policy implications and societal impacts of air pollution for regions with environmental justice vs. injustice. The proposed work will not only benefit NAQFC, RRFS-UFS, and other stakeholders, but also inform future model improvement for EPA's CMAQ, NOAA's WRF-Chem, and other community models.

quality predictions during wildfires by exploring and quantifying the potential value of
ensemble predictions of air quality with a novel ensemble design using RRFS-CMAQ. We
will follow a methodology developed by the project PIs for probabilistic PM2.5 forecasts. The
project will build off of the next generation air quality model named RRFS-CMAQ. We will use
the extreme fire season of June-October 2020 as a testbed for developing, evaluating, and
optimizing the ensemble size for operational applications. Our ensemble members will perturb
key aspects of air quality modeling: (a) meteorological and chemical initial and lateral boundary
conditions, (b) anthropogenic, biogenic, and biomass burning emissions, (c) secondary organic
aerosol (SOA) response to temperature changes and updating the solubility of semi-volatile
organic compounds (SVOCs), and (d) removal processes including the hygroscopicity of
aerosols and dry deposition velocities of O3, precursors, and SVOCs. The combination of these
perturbations can result in a large number (> 50) of ensemble members which could be
computationally infeasible for the NAQFC operations. We will address this limitation with a
down-selection technique developed by the PIs to reduce the number of proposed ensemble
members down to 10 while preserving for the most part the skills and quality of the original
ensemble. We will also apply bias-correction and calibration techniques to reduce the ensemble
expected biases in both the first and second moment of the predictive distribution. To
demonstrate the operational value of probabilistic predictions, we will perform probabilistic air
quality predictions in real-time using the optimized 10-member ensemble during the fire season
of 2024. The proposed ensemble is expected to significantly improve the accuracy of operational
O3 and PM2.5 predictions, with the calibrated ensemble mean being the best forecast than any of
the ensemble members. Furthermore, the proposed quantification of O3 and PM2.5 prediction
uncertainty will be a key factor to support cost-effective air quality decision-making activities.","The proposed improvements in the accuracy of the NAQFC deterministic O3
and PM2.5 predictions, along with a reliable quantification of their uncertainties, will allow air quality forecasters across the nation to put more confidence in using the NAQFC products in their decision-making process and better protect public health. As shown in our recent studies, a calibrated dynamical ensemble exhibited almost zero MB across seasons with the reduction in MB by 40-100% and the RMSE by 13-40% in different parts of CONUS (Kumar et al., 2020a).","EMC","Jeff McQueen (EMC)

Canopy Processes to Improve U.S. Air Quality Predictions, is submitted to the FY2022 NOAA-
OAR-WPO Funding Opportunity, specifically the Atmospheric Composition (AC) Competition.
In this three-year project, we propose to advance the next-generation Rapid-Refresh Forecast
System (RRFS)-Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model beyond its ""Big-Leaf""
canopy approximation by using forest canopy processes and novel satellite data that can
ultimately improve ozone predictions in the U.S. This work has implications for the RRFS-
CMAQ, and other next-generation, Unified Forecast System-based Atmospheric Composition-
Limited Area Model (AC-LAM) predictions at NOAA, while further providing necessary
scientific advancements to improve chemical transport models in the scientific community.
This project follows a three-step/year integrated process centered on improving RRFS-CMAQ:
1. Advanced development of observation- and theoretically-based forest in-canopy
parameterizations that include photolysis attenuation, turbulence effects, and
emissions/scalar transport (Years 1-2).
2. Incorporation and testing of novel satellite-based land surface/vegetation data from the
Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), which includes updated forest canopy
heights, to further advance the canopy parameterizations (Year 2).
3. Full-year simulations and evaluation using both 2D and 3D observations to demonstrate
model performance changes and readiness for R2O transition (Year 3).","Addition of in-canopy effects and improved canopy representation will leverage the UFS-based coupling strategy between the meteorological, land, and chemistry model components in a more physically consistent fashion within the RRFS-CMAQ framework. In this way, for example, the land surface model component can be directly coupled (e.g., LAI) with the in-canopy parameterizations in the integrated physics and chemistry model components in RRFS-CMAQ. The addition of GEDI canopy information (e.g., canopy height) is also particularly important for operational NOAA AQF models. This is because of 1) relatively high complexity and spatial resolutions needed to accurately represent land cover and vegetative characteristics,
2) inclusion of comprehensive atmospheric chemistry and aerosol formation components in RRFS-CMAQ, and 3) interactions of 1 and 2 via atmosphere-biosphere exchange, chemistry, and scalar transport that are critical to chemical and aerosol predictions.","EMC","Fanglin Yang (EMC)","George Mason University","NA22OAR4590516","Extreme Temperatures","Virginia","Campbell","","2022","August 2022 - July 2025","<span class=""material-symbols-outlined status-icon active"" title=""Active"">search_activity</span>","Atmospheric Composition and Chemistry, Dynamics and Nesting, Parameterization, Satellite & Remote Sensing Technologies","beyond the ""big leaf"" model at noaa use of novel satellite data and in canopy processes to improve u s air quality predictions, this project follows a three step year integrated process centered on improving rrfs cmaq, the proposal beyond the ""big leaf"" model at noaa use of novel satellite data and in canopy processes to improve u s air quality predictions is submitted to the fy2022 noaa oar wpo funding opportunity specifically the atmospheric composition ac competition in this three year project we propose to advance the next generation rapid refresh forecast system rrfs community multiscale air quality cmaq model beyond its ""big leaf"" canopy approximation by using forest canopy processes and novel satellite data that can ultimately improve ozone predictions in the u s this work has implications for the rrfs cmaq and other next generation unified forecast system based atmospheric composition limited area model ac lam predictions at noaa while further providing necessary scientific advancements to improve chemical transport models in the scientific community this project follows a three step year integrated process centered on improving rrfs cmaq 1 advanced development of observation and theoretically based forest in canopy parameterizations that include photolysis attenuation turbulence effects and emissions scalar transport years 1 2 2 incorporation and testing of novel satellite based land surface vegetation data from the global ecosystem dynamics investigation gedi which includes updated forest canopy heights to further advance the canopy parameterizations year 2 3 full year simulations and evaluation using both 2d and 3d observations to demonstrate model performance changes and readiness for r2o transition year 3","Environmental Modeling Center (EMC)","George Mason University","<img src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PART-WPO/SPARK/refs/heads/main/icons/extremetemp-tp.PNG"" alt=""Extreme Temperatures"" />","https://part-wpo.github.io/reach-dashboard/?award=NA22OAR4590516","This project follows a three-step/year integrated process centered on improving RRFS-CMAQ."

behavior model accounts for fire-atmosphere feedbacks. It receives winds and humidity from the

atmosphere by releasing heat and moisture, and produces smoke from the combustion process.

uncertainties still exist in model representations of key processes of fire weather, limiting our
collective capability to predict and mitigate fire damages at different time scales. Predictability of
fire weather at the sub-seasonal to seasonal (S2S) time scale is particularly desirable for response
management and weather forecast. While exerting immediate effects on local weather, large fires
unfold their full effects on weather and climate through complicated interactions in the Earth
system. Improving S2S wildfire forecasts will enhance the predictability of several NOAA
forecasting products for societal services (firefighting advisory, air quality and health early
warning). The objective of this work is to improve S2S wildfire emission forecasting, a key source
of uncertainty in Fire Weather S2S Forecasting.","There is a large uncertainty in the representation of biomass burning aerosol composition and
its optical properties in the Subseasonal to Seasonal (S2S) aerosol modeling. This comprehensive
fire dataset will help modelers to further adjust the parameterizations and reduce the uncertainty, and ultimately
improve the modeled aerosol effects on incoming solar radiation in the S2S forecast. Specifically,
the proposed project will improve the accuracy of emission inputs to NOAA Unified Forecast
System (UFS) models developed by GSL for the NWS. The current operational forecast models
for weather, S2S and air quality will also be improved with this new set of wildfire emission input,
e.g., Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS)-Aerosols, Unified Forecast System (UFS)-Aerosols, 
regional Finite Volume Cubed Sphere-Community Multiscale Air Quality (FV3-CMAQ), and 
Rapid Refresh Forecast System (RRFS). In addition, this work contributes to advancing emission 
science, atmospheric chemistry modeling, and Earth system modeling. It will also benefit the research
communities globally who need fire emission.

of ensemble postprocessing; and more specifically, it explores the possibility of fusing the ML
with traditional parametric approach in producing skillful probabilistic guidance of precipitation
amounts and using ML alone for generating probabilistic precipitation types. The initiative builds
on past efforts by the project team that led to the development of the hybrid Artificial Neural
Network-Censored Shifted Gamma Distribution (ANN-CSGD) scheme at UT Arlington, and the
Regularized Bayesian Classifier (RBC) at PSL. The new schemes to be developed and tested will
include a novel LSTM-CSGD hybrid processor for precipitation forecast that uses advanced
recurrent neural networks to account for time-dependent impacts of meteorological variables, and
a tailored multi-class ANN algorithms for precipitation type forecasts. These innovations have the
potential of enhancing the skills of PQPF for thresholds beyond 3-5in/day for lead times out to day
8, and expanding the forecasted wintertime precipitation types and improving their accuracy and
specificity for day 1-7.
The proposed initiative will be carried out in collaboration with NOAA PSL, NWS WPC/MDL,

and IBM, with the latter two being potential end users. It will yield codes, documents and peer-
reviewed publications that will be shared with collaborators, thus allowing for further evaluations

and paving the way for potential transition to operation. The benefits will be multifold. First, the
algorithm for producing PQPFs addresses limited skills of current ensemble postprocessing
schemes in the National Blend and WPC in forecasting heavy-to-extreme precipitation and
precipitation types.","These innovations have the potential of enhancing the skills of PQPF for thresholds beyond 3-5in/day for lead times out to day 8, and expanding the forecasted wintertime precipitation types and improving their accuracy and specificity for day 1-7.

The anticipated impacts/benefits of the undertaking are six-fold:
1. The project will yield novel postprocessing algorithms of UFS that could address critical
gaps of extant operational schemes in predicting extreme and enhance the skills of NWP
forecasts in predicting the chance of extreme precipitation and wintertime precipitation
types over the short and medium range.
2. The collaborative evaluation of first-guess outlook products through hindcast experiments
that involve newly available GEFSv13 reforecasts will help the research team as well as
collaborators in NOAA and IBM in determining the potential of the schemes in effectively
delineating areas with hazardous weather conditions in the UFS era.
3. The scalability experiments, to be performed on different ensemble forecasts and analysis
products, will inform the potential of the existing as well as newly developed schemes in
adapting to larger ensemble from heterogeneous systems and for producing high-resolution
guidance products; and this will help with planning for computational resources required
to effectively operate these schemes within UFS.
4. The availability of the implementations of these schemes to collaborators will allow for
future, quasi-operational tests, and thereby paves the way for operational adoption by NWS
and commercial entities. In particular, WPC produces ERO and Winter Weather Outlooks
(WWO) to inform the public of the potential for hazardous flashing flooding and winter
weather conditions. The prototype schemes will be evaluated to determine their utility of
in informing potential enhancements of these products with involvement of WPC
collaborator.
5. The project will help train future workforces, and improve weather literacy among
engineers, water managers, and general public. In particular, graduate students from the
UTA research team will gain first-hand knowledge of the forecast processing. Components of the project will be featured in a course taught by the PI titled ""Hydrometeorology and
Remote Sensing"" by Y2, and the topic will help graduate students understand ways of
measuring forecast uncertainty. The project will use the help of summer student interns
with Hispanic origin and will motivate minority students to pursue advanced careers in
STEM.
6. The project will contribute to a concurrent Forecast Informed Reservoir Operation (FIRO)
initiative for the State of Texas led by the PI. Through quarterly meetings and annual
workshop series, the project team will demonstrate the new postprocessing scheme, its
products, and potential skill gains to regional collaborators and stakeholders to spur
interests in the adoption of probabilistic forecasts in decision making.","NWS WPC/MDL

from wildfires using a modified version of the National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) Warn-on-Forecast 
System (WoFS). This system has proven very effective in generating short term (0-6 hour) forecasts
of high impact weather events during testing in several real-time testbeds such as the Hazardous 
Weather Testbed starting in 2017. One feature currently not present within the WoFS version used 
in real-time is the ability to forecast smoke. Forecasts of wildfire smoke can be vital to local emergency 
managers to determine how best to fight a fire and when/where evacuations might be needed. Lofted 
debris, ash, and smoke can reach well into the mid and upper troposphere and smoke aerosols may 
persist in the atmosphere for days or weeks before deposition occurs or they break down chemically. 
In addition, pyro-cumulus (pyro-Cu) and pyro-cumulonimbus (pyro-Cb) can be formed by buoyant 
updrafts generated by the extreme heat, evaporated moisture from burning biomass, and smoke 
aerosols acting as cloud condensation nuclei. The rapidly evolving nature of wildfires is one of many 
reasons that forecasting these conditions is difficult, but recent advances in wildfire observations and 
numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have begun to make progress in this endeavor.

This project will address the following NOAA science priorities for the Fire Weather
objective: FW-2: Smoke transport, evolution, and interaction with meteorology; FW-3: Data 
assimilation of atmospheric and terrestrial conditions needed for all stages of fire weather 
forecasts, and finally FW-5: Fire weather forecast system testing, verification, and 
predictability.","The goal of this research is to create a skillful probabilistic forecasting tool for short-term
smoke forecasts through developing and evaluating new methods for ingesting GOES-R satellite
data into WoFS-Smoke. As such, it satisfies a key program requirement of creating a next
generation coupled wildfire-weather analysis and ensemble-based forecasting system that can lead
to improved forecasts of fire behavior and smoke. Assuming the successful completion of the
proposed objectives, WoFS-Smoke will be able to generate smoke plume forecasts associated with
rapidly evolving fires as well as the ability to forecast the link between wildfires and other high
impact weather. Currently, skillful realtime probabilistic forecasts of these potential impacts are
not readily available to the weather community. The forecasts generated by WoFS-Smoke can be
used by emergency managers, NWS forecasters, media, and other interested parties to help limit
wildfire impacts to both property and human lives. In particular, WoFS-Smoke will be developed
along with the WoFS, and as part of its R2O transition phase, it is planned to train users in its

microphysics and microphysics indirect feedback, which will be consistent with aerosol direct 
feedback for radiation. Cloud drop number and size depend, in part, on aerosol properties, and 
these detailed cloud properties ultimately impact cloud albedo and energy budget, the hydrometeors 
content, cloud cover and lifetime, and they can also further suppress or enhance precipitation.  
This work is expected to result in improved aerosol-aware microphysics and understanding of the 
impact of smoke on weather forecasts in the RRFS over CONUS and Alaska domains. Other physics, such 
as cumulus convection will also be updated to fit this proposed aerosol representation for 
microphysics. Retrospective runs and real-time parallel runs will be executed for verification. The 
subroutines of the improved aerosol representation and modified physics will be committed to the 
UFS community Github code repository. We will report the project progress at scientific conferences and meetings.
We will also publish scientific journal papers with the results and outputs from this project. The final goal of this proposal is to 
implement an improved aerosol representation and microphysics indirect feedback into the next
generation RRFS v2 operational forecast system.","In the proposed modeling framework, the warm-rain/cold-rain processes of the
microphysics will be aware of the wildfire and dust events, and the physics parameterization 
community will benefit from this development. This will allow for the ability to run retrospective 
and real-time forecasts and better understand cloud-precipitation-aerosol-radiation impacts. It is 
also helpful to quantify the impact of smoke/dust on clouds. The 3-km storm-scale weather 
forecasting in RRFS over CONUS and Alaska will benefit from this more realistic aerosol 
representation for microphysics, and the smoke/dust air quality forecast could also be further 
improved with the improved meteorology of the numerical weather forecasting. We will aim to include 
the product of this proposal into the next generation RRFS v2 operational implementation operated 
by NOAA/EMC and NOAA/NCO, and the local weather offices will also be benefited.
The software and code from this proposal will be available in the UFS community GitHub code 
repository. All the proposed code development in this project will follow the CCPP standards and should
should also benefit the CCPP and UFS community researchers, students and public.","","","CIRES/University of Colorado in Boulder

representation of fire-ABL interactions and incorporate two-way feedbacks between fire weather 
and smoke emissions. Specific tasks are 1) implementation of a new parameterization in UFS/RRFS 
that couples fire and meteorology through convective heat/moisture exchange to account for fire- 
induced secondary circulations in the AB; 2) improved estimates of fire emission rates from NOAA's 
weather satellite products (RAVE) and influence of new fire-ABL scheme on modeled plume rise 
dynamics; and 3) simulating the evolution of an active fire to evaluate the new parameterization in 
UFS/RRFS coupled with the Community Multiscale Air Quality modeling system (UFS/RRFS-CMAQ)
against intensively instrumented fire episodes over the western US (FIREX-AQ 2019 campaign).

Project products include an enhanced RRFS model version with higher fidelity in forecasting 
fire-weather evolution (Tasks 1-2) and for evaluating impacts on air quality (Task 3), and the 
production of publicly accessible datasets from simulation output for model diagnosis,
testing, and validation.","This project will provide NOAA National Weather Service and the Office of Oceanic and
Atmospheric Research with an improved RRFS model that accurately simulates short-term fire-
weather evolution to better prepare forest/emergency managers, local and state agencies, and the
public to address wildfire management and impacts. The new high fidelity RRFS model version
can also serve as a testbed for Medium-Range Weather (MRW) and sub-seasonal-to-seasonal
(S2S) applications in the UFS modeling suite. When coupled with CMAQ, the model provides
improved air quality forecasts of wildfire emissions and impacts.
The project is also intended to provide the scientific community with an open-source code
repository that advances the scientific rigor of wildfire-ABL modeling, provide open-access data
for benchmarking measurements and simulations, and for the development of model diagnostics.","","","Northeastern University, George Mason University, EMC","NA25OARX459C0013","Fire Weather","Massachusetts","Ghanam","","2025","February 2025 - January 2027","<span class=""material-symbols-outlined status-icon active"" title=""Active"">search_activity</span>","Atmospheric Composition and Chemistry, Coupled Models & Techniques, Dynamics and Nesting, Parameterization, Satellite & Remote Sensing Technologies, Verification & Validation","towards improved representations of wildfire abl interactions in the ufs modeling suite parameterization development emissions modeling and air quality impact assessment, to provide an accurate modeling system for noaa forecasters forest emergency response managers and local and state agencies to address wildfire risks and impacts, this project is to enhance rrfs's short term wildfire forecasting capability by improving rrfs's representation of fire abl interactions and incorporate two way feedbacks between fire weather and smoke emissions specific tasks are 1 implementation of a new parameterization in ufs rrfs that couples fire and meteorology through convective heat moisture exchange to account for fire induced secondary circulations in the ab 2 improved estimates of fire emission rates from noaa's weather satellite products rave and influence of new fire abl scheme on modeled plume rise dynamics and 3 simulating the evolution of an active fire to evaluate the new parameterization in ufs rrfs coupled with the community multiscale air quality modeling system ufs rrfs cmaq against intensively instrumented fire episodes over the western us firex aq 2019 campaign project products include an enhanced rrfs model version with higher fidelity in forecasting fire weather evolution tasks 1 2 and for evaluating impacts on air quality task 3 and the production of publicly accessible datasets from simulation output for model diagnosis testing and validation","","Northeastern University, George Mason University, EMC","<img src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PART-WPO/SPARK/refs/heads/main/icons/fire%20weather-tp.png"" alt=""Wildfire"" />","https://part-wpo.github.io/reach-dashboard/?award=NA25OARX459C0013","To provide an accurate modeling system for NOAA forecasters, forest/emergency response managers, and local and state agencies to address wildfire risks and impacts."
